# IGACSE (Interactive Graph Algorithms for Computer Science Education)
For my Thesis on Videogames for teaching Graph-related Algorithms

The game is being developed in the Godot Game Engine.

The idea of this game is to make the steps a computer must perform in order fo do graph-related algorithms, like  BFS, DFS, Prim and Kruskal.
The user must follow a sequence of instructions to perform the given algorithm. Each algorithm represents a level.
