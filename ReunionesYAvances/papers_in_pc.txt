MEEGA+: 
The model measures the reaction of students after they played the game by applying a standar-
dized questionnaire answered by the students.
It has been developed by using the GQM (Goal/Question/Metric) approach (Basili et al., 1994)
To evalute 3 quality factors of ED games: motivation, user experience, and learning (Savi et al., 2011)

Made by:
Systematic Literature Review (SLR)[...] in different contexts using MEEGA.
Identified 60 case studies, 24 different digital and non-digital games,
Total population of 1000 students from 6 different institutions.

======= Motivation ====== Attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction. 
The quality factor motivation was decomposed based on the ARCS model (Keller, 1987), a
well-known model of motivation that has also been used in several studies to assess the mo-
tivation of students utilizing educational resources, including also educational games (Demp-
sey & Johnson, 1998; Huang et al., 2010).
The ARCS model decomposes motivation into four dimensions: attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction. 

* Attention refers to students' cognitive responses to instructional stimuli.
* Relevance refers to the studentsâ€™ need to realize that the educational proposal is consistent 
with their goals and that they can link content with their professional future. 

* Confidence means to enable students to make progress in the study of educational content through their effort and ability (e.g., through exercises with
increasing level of difficulty). 

* Satisfaction means that the students feel that the dedicated effort results in learning.

======= UX ====== immersion, challenge, social interaction, fun, and competence/control.
* Quality factor user experience was decomposed into the following dimensions (Sweetser
& Wyeth, 2005; Poels et al., 2007; Takatalo et al., 2010): immersion, challenge, social interaction, fun, and competence/control.

* Immersion allows the player to have an experience of deep involvement within the game, creating a challenge with real-world focus, so that they
forget about the outside world during gameplay
