# Graph Visualizer

An educative application to learn graph-related algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Kruskal and Prim.
This application was made in Godot using mainly GDScript. C# is used in critical processing scripts.
The purpose of this job is to analyze if this interactive application help new CS students to learn new algorithms and data structures.

Renderer: GLES 3

## Some Ideas for the future

* Adding a graph creator: An user may create a graph and perform one of the given algorithms on it

* Adding more ideas to gamify the project: Scores, timers, tutorials, secrets, easter egss, etc

* Adding Multiplayer: You advance two lines of code, I do another two!

* Adding more algorithms with the same idea and pattern. Maybe not for graphs, like array sorting, searching algorithms and others...

* Adding more actions to the game, like dragging structures, adding sounds, visual effects...

* Adding a story

* Adding a test, to check whether the player understood the algorithms well enough
