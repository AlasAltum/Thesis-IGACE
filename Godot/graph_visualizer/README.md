# Graph Visualizer

An educative interactive application to learn graph-related algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Kruskal and Prim.
This application was made in Godot using mainly GDScript. C# was used in the beggining, but it does not allow to export games to HTML5, so it is not being used anymore.
The purpose of this job is to analyze if this interactive application help new CS students to learn new algorithms and data structures.

Renderer: GLES 3

## Some Ideas for the future

* Adding a graph creator: An user may create a graph and perform one of the given algorithms on it

* Adding more ideas to gamify the project: Scores, timers, tutorials, secrets, easter egss, etc

* Adding Multiplayer: You advance two lines of code, I do another two!

* Adding more algorithms with the same idea and pattern. Maybe not for graphs, like array sorting, searching algorithms and others...

*
